Materials for University College Cork BEES module, BL6024 Quantitative Skills for Biologists using R

## Road Map

### 1.	Introduction to R and Rstudio  
* Open source  
* Console, script and plot windows  
* Packages  
* Troubleshooting and getting help (Googling R, help pages)  
* Samples of R potential (without going into the code)  

### 2.	Data exploration and visualization  
* Checking normality, homoscedasticity, outliers, transformations, etc.  
* Basic plots  
* Intro to ggplot2  
* Main types of plots  

### 3.	Implementation and interpretation of tests (Part 1)
* Chi-square
* Correlation
* t-test
* one-way ANOVA and post-hoc tests
* 2-way ANOVA
* ANCOVA
* Non-parametric alternatives
* Reporting results
*In-class CA covering sessions 1-3*

###  4.	Implementation and interpretation of tests (Part 2)
* Linear regression

### 5.	More advanced linear models
* GLMs
* Model simplification and selection
* Multiple regression

### 6.	Even more advanced linear models
* Mixed models
* GAMs
*In-class CA covering sessions 4-6*

### 7.	Multiparametric tests and other cool stuff
* Disciminant functions
* PCA
* Non-metric multidimensional scaling
* Biodiversity quantification
* Mantel test
* PGLS

### 8.	Introduction to mathematical modelling
* Main functions
* Loops

### 9.	Advanced visualization
* Spatial visualization
*In-class CA covering sessions 7-9*

### 10.	Bayesian statistics
* Frequentist vs Bayesian
* Simple approaches

*Final report*
