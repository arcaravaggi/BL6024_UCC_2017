# Insulin sensitivity
# From Borkman et al. 1993

# Insulin sensitivity (i.e. the rate of glucose uptake to muscles
# as a direct result of blood insulin levels) is extremely variable
# in healthy individuals. To understand this, Borkman et al., (1993) 
# hypothesised that insulin sensitivity was affected by fatty acid
# content of the cell membrane of skeletal muscle. This hypothesis
# was based on the fact that insulin promotes the uptake of glucose
# by these cell through the membrane. We will look at some of the data
# collected.

### A new government investment scheme has been suggested 
### which includes increased investment in amenity forestry.  
### This scheme will cost the tax payer approximately 
### Â£80,000,000 per annum.
### The scheme will improve access and facilities as forest parks 
### (e.g. parking, toilets, security, signage etc.) 
### and provide new jobs in rural areas 
### 
### We want to know how popular this investment would be and whether
### the response is correlated with whether people come from urban or 
### rural areas.  We have measured support for the scheme using a 7 point
### Likert scale  (i.e. Strongly disagree, disagree, somewhat disagree, 
### neither agree nor disagree, somewhat agree, agree, strongly agree)

### there is a small positive correllation between distance
### from city and willingness to invest in amenity forestry

### However, this correllation is not significant, therefore we must 
### conclude that there is no real correlation between distance from city

# The big bang model of the origin of the universe states that it expands 
# uniformly, and locally, according to Hubble's law: y = Bx
# y = the velocity of any two galaxies
# x = their distance of seperation
# B = Hubble's constant

# B^-1 gives the approximate age of the universe, but is unknown. Thus, it 
# must be estimated from known observations of y and x.

# This can be done using a linear regression
