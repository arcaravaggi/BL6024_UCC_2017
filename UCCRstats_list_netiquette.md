These informal rules and procedures relate to the UCCRstats-L mailing list. They have been established for users of the mailing list to provide simple guidelines to make its use  more enjoyable and less annoying or bothersome.

You can join the list by emailing **UCCRSTATS-L-subscribe-request@lists.ucc.ie**

1. Be sure to include a descriptive subject line. E-mails received with no subject line may likely be perceived as spam by an email filter and be deleted before reaching the recipient's inbox.

2. Personal replies should be directed to specific individuals rather than to the entire list. Remember to cut and paste the sender’s e-mail address when replying rather than simply hitting the “Reply” button which sends the response to the entire list.

3. If you receive a notice that your original e-mail was 'rejected' or you received a 'delivery error', find out the reason for the rejection before resending the message so people do not receive duplicate e-mails. Often times, the error was in response to a problem with a single recipient's email and the message was indeed sent and received by many other list subscribers.

4. This mailing list may not be used for the solicitation, promotion, or sales of commercial products or services. Violaters will be immediately removed from the list.

5. This mailing list may not be used to promote or engage in political activities. Violaters will be immediately removed.

6. This mailing list may not be used for posting job announcements or position descriptions.

7. This mailing list is not to be used as a personal blog. It is intended for distributing topic-related information that the list members as a group might benefit from sharing.

8. Antisocial behaviour is not permitted. Violaters will be removed from the list.

9. Be respectful and considerate of your colleagues in your postings. If you disagree or become upset with someone's response or use of the list, reply to that person directly when appropriate.

10. Become familiar with the features, settings, options and other capabilities of your e-mail client system.
